Pardoned J'ish criminals... quite a list. <!--1347374418981478402-->

But on any discussion of policy you either blame the GOP or go back to insisting he's the best you've got. There's no way out of the ideological prison you've built around yourself. <!--1347371729216274432-->

Trump didn't have to appoint the people he appointed, move the embassy, pardon Rubashkin and Charles Kushner, create the platinum plan or stab his loyalists in the back. <!--1347370870122160128-->

Trump has consistently had the backing of the most hawkish Zionist elements (Chabad, Likud, Adelson).  You could always just point to Trump's policy achievements if he has really done so much to hold the line. <!--1347368372015607808-->

You are purely focused on spectacle and think discussing his dismal record is somehow an unfair approach. <!--1347366836455809024-->

Is that low hanging fruit or something? You're still fixated on him cynically appealing to nationalist sentiment (which I acknowledge had some positive effects) in 2016. He governed like any other Republican. <!--1347365203298701313-->

The Republican Party exists to represent one side of a J*wish familial dispute. My answer is an actual nationalist movement rather than a figure who is explicitly against our aims and interests. <!--1347359885432938496-->

That people like you are still holding onto hope that he will find a way to keep power and hold off the globalists shows why people needed to be blackpilled on him. Sadly many didn't get the message. <!--1347359236834127873-->

A conman who used his time in office to pass tax cuts for billionaires, do nothing about censorship, pardon J*wish criminals, move the embassy to Jerusalem and lead his loyalists into a bumfight that will get them a life behind bars <!--1347357788641636353-->

He has always been a conman and his supporters deserve better. <!--1347357080110432256-->

If only someone could have warned people. <!--1347355244062265344-->
