At a certain point reducing everything to racial pragmatism fails. <!--1312883849815351298-->

You haven't justified this at all and made many claims that show you're clueless on the topic (Buddhism was racial, Hinduism rejects hierarchy and is proselytising) <!--1312883336902324225-->

There isn't much difference between the teaching of Eckhart and Buddha, Lao Tzu or Sankara. They make remarkably bold and specific claims but differ little in the view they expound.

Metaphysical idealism is the truth and would be the teaching of every religion if not for varying layers of exoteric stuff.
